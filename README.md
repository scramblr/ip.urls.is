# ip.urls.is
PHP Source For ip.urls.is IP Echo &amp; Startpage

This is the code that runs both http://ip.urls.is as well as the startpage located at http://ip.urls.is/startpage.

The server is intentionally configured to allow both http and https connections without forcing HTTPS upgrade since it's a diagnostic tool.

The ASN database can be found here: https://files.catbox.moe/fs8jte.db
If it gets deleted, I won't fix it. But, you can ask me for it and I'll send it.

If you see any ways to make the code more efficient or want something added, feel free to do a pull req or ask about it. 

Peace!
