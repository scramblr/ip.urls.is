# ip.urls.is
PHP Source For ip.urls.is IP Echo &amp; Startpage

This is the code that runs both http://ip.urls.is as well as the startpage located at http://ip.urls.is/startpage.

The server is intentionally configured to allow both http and https connections without forcing HTTPS upgrade since it's a diagnostic tool.

If you see any ways to make the code more efficient or want something added, feel free to do a pull req or ask about it. 

Peace!
